# Gender-Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for a gender classification system using machine learning. The system is designed to classify the gender of individuals based on various features, such as facial characteristics and . Machine learning models are employed to automate the gender identification process, making it useful for a variety of applications, including gender-based personalization, marketing, and demographic analysis.

## ABOUT THE DATASET

The dataset used for this project should contain features and labels for gender classification. The dataset contains features like:
- long_hair
- forehead_width_cm
- forehead_height_cm
- nose_wide
- nose_long
- lips_thin
- distance_nose_to_lip_long
- gender(target label)

Several classification algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random forest, decision tree and KNN were used to train the dataset and the models were evaluated.
